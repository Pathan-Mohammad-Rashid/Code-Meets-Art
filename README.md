### Description of Work/Art/Code:
In this mesmerizing digital creations, I weaves a captivating spiral using only straight lines. Inspired by a profound love for art and driven by a passion for computer science, I explores the infinite possibilities of expression. Varying angles, lengths of lines, and a repetitive loop produce an array of visually appealing masterpieces, showcasing the limitless potential of transforming artistic vision into code-driven beauty. Each line is a stroke of creativity, collectively forming billions of unique artworks.
